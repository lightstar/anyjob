Use `/delay` to delay new job in AnyJob system or perform some operation with delayed works.

Include delay time or crontab specification as first argument, job type as second argument and optionally nodes,
parameters and properties.
After crontab specification you can type '@skip <count>' to specify delay skip count and '@paused' to set this work
on pause.
When something is omitted, then default values will be used.

Also you can use one of operation names as first argument to perform it. Supported ones are: update, schedule, skip,
pause, resume, delete and get.
Update, schedule, skip, pause, resume and delete operations require integer delayed work identificator as second
argument.

Some examples:
`/delay '2018-08-12 12:00:00' kill server1,server2 who=badUser`
`/delay update 3 kill server1,server2 who=badUser`
`/delay schedule 3 '*/5' @skip 2`
`/delay skip 3 5`
`/delay pause 3`
`/delay resume 3`
`/delay delete 3`
`/delay get`
END
