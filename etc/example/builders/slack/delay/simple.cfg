Use `/delay` to delay new job in AnyJob system or perform some operation with delayed works.

Include delay time as fist argument, job type as second argument and optionally nodes, parameters and properties.
When something is omitted, then default values will be used.

Also you can use one of operation names as first argument to perform it. Supported ones are: update, delete and get.
Update and delete operations require integer delayed work identificator as second argument.

Some examples:
`/delay '2018-08-12 12:00:00' kill server1,server2 who=badUser`
`/delay update 3 '2018-08-12 12:00:00' kill server1,server2 who=badUser`
`/delay delete 3`
`/delay get`
END
