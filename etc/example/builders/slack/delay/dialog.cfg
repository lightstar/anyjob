Use `/delayd` to delay job in AnyJob system using dialog to enter additional job parameters.

Include delay time or crontab specification as first argument, job type as second argument and optionally nodes, parameters and properties.
After crontab specification you can type '@skip <count>' to specify delay skip count and '@paused' to set this work on pause.
When something is omitted, then default values will be used.

Some examples:
`/delayd '2018-08-12 12:00:00' kill server1,server2 who=badUser`
`/delayd update 3 kill server1,server2 who=badUser`
END
