All keys created in redis are described here. They have prefix 'anyjob:' and are divided into 3 different groups:
queues, data storage and id generators. Details about stored data and sent messages are in comments throughout code.

1. Queues.

anyjob:queue:<node>             - queue for create messages processed by node controllers.
anyjob:queue                    - queue for create messages processed by global controller.
anyjob:progressq:<node>         - queue for progress messages processed by node controllers.
anyjob:progressq                - queue for progress messages processed by global controller.
anyjob:workerq:<node>:<name>    - queue for job messages processed by worker daemons.
anyjob:observerq:<name>         - queue for events processed by observer with specified name.
anyjob:observerq:private:<name> - queue for events processed by private observer with specified name.

2. Data storage.

anyjob:jobs:<node>              - sorted set with ids of all active jobs on specified node.
anyjob:job:<id>                 - job data in JSON format for specified job id.
anyjob:jobsets                  - sorted set with ids of all active jobsets.
anyjob:jobset:<id>              - jobset data in JSON format for specified jobset id.
anyjob:observer:<name>:log      - sorted set with job ids for which logs were collected by observer with specified name.
anyjob:observer:<name>:log:<id> - list with log data collected by observer with specified name for job with specified id.
anyjob:builds                   - sorted set with ids of all active creator builds.
anyjob:build:<id>               - build data in JSON format for specified build id.

3. Id generators

anyjob:job:id                   - last job id.
anyjob:jobset:id                - last jobset id.
anyjob:build:id                 - last build id.
