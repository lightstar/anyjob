1. Configuration location, sections and default sections.

Configuration is done via configuration files. The path to main configuration file can be set in ANYJOB_CONF
environment variable. By default it is '<ANYJOB_PATH>/etc/current/anyjob.cfg', where '<ANYJOB_PATH>' is path to anyjob
installation set in ANYJOB_PATH environment variable (by default '/opt/anyjob').

Configuration file must be divided into sections designated with line containing section name in square brackets.
Each section consists of zero or more key-value pairs like this:

[section]
key = value
...

In addition to main configuration file configuration files are searched in some other paths. Key-value pairs
in this files can have no explicit section name, in which case the default section name for this file is used.
- builders path.
      Default: 'builders' directory in main configuration file base path.
      Default section name prefix: 'builder_'.
- jobs path.
      Default: 'jobs' directory in main configuration file base path.
      Default section name prefix: 'job_'.
- nodes path.
      Default: 'nodes' directory in main configuration file base path.
      Default section name prefix: 'node_'.
- observers path.
      Default: 'observers' directory in main configuration file base path.
      Default section name prefix: 'observer_'.

All these paths are searched for any files with '.cfg' extension and their names are concatenated to default section
name. For example if in nodes path lies file named 'broadcast.cfg', all this file content without explicit section
name will belong to section 'node_broadcast'. Names of all intermediate subdirectories are concatenated to default
section name too, separated by underscores, so for file in builds path named 'slack/simple.cfg' default section name
will be 'builder_slack_simple'.

2. Key-value pairs.

Each key-value pair consists of key and value separated by equal sign. Space characters around each line,
key and value are ignored. Example:

key = value

By default each key-value pair must occupy just one line, but if there is backslash symbol at the end, value content
will prolong to the next line. The backslash symbol itself is stripped as well as space characters at the end and
beginning of each line (but not before backslash symbol). Example:

key = some long \
      value

This is the same as:
key = some long value

Also limited 'here document' syntax can be used if value is too long to comfortably use backslashes. Example:

key = <<END
This value is extremely
long.
END

This is the same as:
key = This value is extremely long.

This syntax is especially useful for json objects included in configuration.

3. Global configuration section.

Global configuration section is named 'anyjob' and must contain (surprisingly) anyjob global configuration.
Below are all recognizible keys.
